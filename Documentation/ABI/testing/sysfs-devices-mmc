Description:
		High Priority Interrupt is a new feature defined in eMMC4.4
		standard. If this feature is enabled, stack needs to decide
		till what time since the last issued request is considered
		preemptible. This attribute value (in milliseconds) is
		used for arriving at the most optimal value for a specific
		card. Default is zero, which also disables the feature, as
		the request becomes non-preemptible immediately.
